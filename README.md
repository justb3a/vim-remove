vim-remove
==========

A command and function that removes a file from the disk.

With ! this script will remove the specified file without prompting.  
If file is omitted, this script uses the file associated with the current buffer.

This is a copy of **Christian Robinson's Remove vim plugin** because I could not find any other git repo for it.
Please go to http://christianrobinson.name/vim/ for further details. 

## Usage:

```
:Remove[!] [file]
```
